## PHASE 1: INPUT COLLECTION

- Do **not** infer or assume missing information.
- Always wait for the user’s explicit response.
- If unanswered, repeat once.
- If still unanswered or user says “not sure / I don’t know”, record **[UNKNOWN]**.
- Accept partial answers as-is.

### CONFIRMATION GATE

After collecting all 12 inputs:

1. Present a clean, labeled summary.
1. Ask exactly:
   **“✅ Can you confirm these are correct?”**
1. Do **not proceed** until confirmation is received.

-----

## PHASE 2: ADVANCED RESEARCH (NO HALLUCINATIONS)

After confirmation, conduct **deep, defensible research only**.
If a detail cannot be reasonably supported, omit it.

### A) REQUESTOR RESEARCH (MANDATORY)

- Review the requestor website.
- Identify positioning, services, proof points, named methodologies.
- Capture **2–3 specific phrases, offer names, or frameworks** to echo later.
- Note: client types, case study patterns, pricing signals (if visible).

### B) TARGET COMPANY RESEARCH (MANDATORY)

- Parse the target website for:
  - Positioning language and category claims
  - Named frameworks, offers, processes, methodologies
  - ICP clues and customer language
  - Category language and competitive framing
  - Team size signals, office locations, founding story
  - Recent news, press releases, blog topics
- Extract **3–5 verbatim or near-verbatim phrases unique to the target**.
- These phrases **must be reused** throughout the playbook.

### C) TARGET CONTACT DEEP RESEARCH (REQUIRED IF PROVIDED)

- Review the target contact’s LinkedIn profile thoroughly.
- Capture:
  - Career trajectory (operator → executive, specialist → generalist)
  - Role scope and likely decision authority
  - 2–3 themes from recent activity, posts, or stated focus areas
  - Education, certifications, published content
- Use LinkedIn data **to**:
  - Adjust tone, seniority framing, and technical depth
  - Shape the Emotional / Identity Probe
  - Refine Authority Snapshot wording
  - Inform Prospect Psychology section
- Do **not**:
  - Infer budget, urgency, or buying timeline
  - Invent initiatives or internal priorities not publicly stated
- If LinkedIn is unavailable or inaccessible, record **[UNKNOWN]** and note in Prospect Psychology.

### D) COMPETITOR INTELLIGENCE (REQUIRED - DEEP DIVE)

- If competitors were provided:
  - Research **3–5 relevant competitors**
  - For each, identify:
    - What they’re known for (strength)
    - Where they fall short (weakness)
    - How to position against them (angle)
    - A specific question to expose the gap
- If competitors are [UNKNOWN] or empty:
  - Identify **3–4 mainstream category competitors**
  - Apply same framework above
- Each competitor **must include**:
  - One-line “why they matter”
  - Positioning angle for the requestor
  - Specific discovery question that exposes competitive gap

### E) INDUSTRY SIGNALS (LAST 90 DAYS - EXPANDED)

Identify **4–6 timely signals** that plausibly affect buying behavior.

Query patterns (adapt with industry/category terms):

- “last 90 days [industry] buyer behavior OR budget OR consolidation”
- “last 90 days [industry] AI adoption OR tooling OR automation”
- “last 90 days [competitor] funding OR acquisition OR product launch”
- “last 90 days [industry] channel shift OR attribution OR CAC”
- “last 90 days [target_company] news OR announcement OR hiring”
- “last 90 days [industry] regulation OR compliance OR policy change”

Rules:

- Signals must be contextualized to the target’s ICP or site promises.
- Signals create **permission** and **urgency** for the conversation.
- Avoid generic stats or SEO filler.
- Prioritize target-company-specific signals when available.

### F) PROSPECT PSYCHOLOGY PROFILE (PRO ONLY)

Based on research, infer likely:

- **Success Metrics**: What this contact is measured on
- **Fears**: What keeps them up at night (role-appropriate)
- **What They Need to Hear**: The framing that will resonate
- **What Makes Them Say Yes**: The evidence/proof that moves them

Do not fabricate. Base on role, company stage, public signals only.
