    <h1>WTF SALES METHOD</h1>
    <div class="subtitle">The Trust Layer Every Other Framework Skips</div>
    <div class="tagline">
        A 3-pillar framework for building trust-based selling relationships 
        that makes every other sales methodology actually work
    </div>
</div>

<div class="container">

    <!-- THE PROBLEM -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>THE MISSING LAYER</h2>

        <p>You've been trained in SPIN Selling. Or Challenger. Or Sandler. Or MEDDIC. Or Gap Selling.</p>

        <p>They're all tactical frameworks. They tell you <strong>what questions to ask</strong> or <strong>how to position value</strong> or <strong>when to push back</strong>.</p>

        <p>But they all assume the same thing:</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            The buyer already trusts you.
        </div>

        <p>And that's the problem.</p>

        <p><strong>SPIN doesn't work if the buyer won't answer your diagnostic questions.</strong><br>
        <strong>Challenger doesn't work if the buyer thinks you're just trying to close them.</strong><br>
        <strong>Sandler doesn't work if the buyer won't tolerate your disqualification.</strong><br>
        <strong>MEDDIC doesn't work if you can't get access to decision-makers.</strong><br>
        <strong>Gap Selling doesn't work if the buyer won't show you their gaps.</strong></p>

        <p>None of these frameworks teach you how to build trust first.</p>

        <p>That's what the WTF Sales Method does.</p>

        <p>It's not a replacement for your tactical framework. It's the foundation layer that makes your tactical framework actually work.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- THE 3 PILLARS -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>THE 3 PILLARS</h2>

        <p>The WTF Method has three pillars. Master these and every other sales methodology becomes 10x more effective.</p>

        <div class="pillar">
            <div class="pillar-number">01</div>
            <div class="pillar-title">RADICAL RELEVANCE</div>
            <p><strong>Show them you understand their world before you pitch your solution.</strong></p>
            <p>This is cultural shorthand. Peer validation. The moment they think: "This person gets it."</p>
            <p>Most reps lead with: "Tell me about your business."</p>
            <p>That's lazy. It signals: "I didn't do my homework."</p>
            <p>Instead, you lead with proof of understanding:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"Most agencies your size are struggling with X right now. Is that hitting you too?"</li>
                <li>"I saw you just launched Y. That usually means Z is about to become a problem."</li>
                <li>"You're probably dealing with [specific pain point]. Every agency at your stage does."</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You're not guessing. You're demonstrating pattern recognition.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Buyers pick vendors who understand their context. If you can describe their problem better than they can, they assume you can solve it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="pillar">
            <div class="pillar-number">02</div>
            <div class="pillar-title">DIAGNOSTIC GENEROSITY</div>
            <p><strong>Give value before you ask for the sale.</strong></p>
            <p>Not free strategy sessions. Not free consulting. But insights, connections, frameworks—things that make them smarter whether they buy or not.</p>
            <p>This is the opposite of "always be closing."</p>
            <p>This is "always be teaching."</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"Here's the framework we use with clients like you. Even if we don't work together, this will help."</li>
                <li>"I can intro you to someone who solved this exact problem. No strings attached."</li>
                <li>"Let me send you our diagnostic tool. Run it yourself. You'll know within 10 minutes if we can help."</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Generosity creates reciprocity. When you give first, buyers feel obligated to give back. Usually with their time, attention, and honesty.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="pillar">
            <div class="pillar-number">03</div>
            <div class="pillar-title">PERMISSION-BASED PROGRESSION</div>
            <p><strong>Stop pushing. Start pulling.</strong></p>
            <p>Ask for permission at every stage. Remove all buyer resistance by making them co-author the sale.</p>
            <p>Most reps assume forward motion: "Let me send you a proposal." "I'll schedule a follow-up." "Here's what we should do next."</p>
            <p>That's pressure. Even when it's subtle.</p>
            <p>Instead, you ask permission:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"Does this make sense so far?"</li>
                <li>"Want me to show you how this works?"</li>
                <li>"Should we keep going or do you need to think about it?"</li>
                <li>"Would it make sense to explore this further?"</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> When buyers give permission, they own the decision. They're not being sold. They're choosing to buy.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- HOW TO USE IT -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>HOW TO DEPLOY IT</h2>

        <p>The WTF Method is a progression, not a script. You don't deploy all three pillars at once. You layer them in sequence.</p>

        <h3>Stage 1: Discovery / First Call</h3>
        <p><strong>Focus:</strong> Radical Relevance + Diagnostic Generosity</p>
        <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Prove you understand their world. Give them something valuable. Earn the right to the next conversation.</p>

        <div class="example bad">
            <div class="example-title">❌ Bad Discovery Opener</div>
            <p>"Thanks for taking the time. I'd love to learn more about your business and see if we might be a good fit."</p>
            <p><em>Why it fails: Generic. Lazy. Signals you didn't do homework.</em></p>
        </div>

        <div class="example good">
            <div class="example-title">✓ Good Discovery Opener</div>
            <p>"I looked at your site and your client roster. You're punching above your weight class—going after enterprise clients with a 12-person team. That usually means you're either nailing positioning or you're drowning in custom scopes. Which one is it?"</p>
            <p><em>Why it works: Demonstrates understanding. Shows pattern recognition. Makes them want to talk.</em></p>
        </div>

        <h3>Stage 2: Demo / Presentation</h3>
        <p><strong>Focus:</strong> Diagnostic Generosity + Permission-Based Progression</p>
        <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Show them how you solve their problem. Check for understanding at every step. Make them co-author the solution.</p>

        <div class="example bad">
            <div class="example-title">❌ Bad Demo Flow</div>
            <p>"Let me walk you through all our features. We have X, Y, and Z. Most clients love this part. Here's how it works..."</p>
            <p><em>Why it fails: Feature dump. No permission checkpoints. They're being presented to, not engaged.</em></p>
        </div>

        <div class="example good">
            <div class="example-title">✓ Good Demo Flow</div>
            <p>"Based on what you told me last week, you're stuck on [specific problem]. Want to see how we solve that? [Wait for yes.] Cool. This is the framework we use. Does this map to how you're thinking about it? [Wait for confirmation.] Good. Let me show you how it works in practice..."</p>
            <p><em>Why it works: Permission at every turn. Confirms relevance. Keeps them engaged.</em></p>
        </div>

        <h3>Stage 3: Close / Negotiation</h3>
        <p><strong>Focus:</strong> All 3 Pillars</p>
        <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Make the close feel inevitable. Remove all resistance. Let them choose to buy.</p>

        <div class="example bad">
            <div class="example-title">❌ Bad Closing Approach</div>
            <p>"So what do you think? Ready to move forward? I can get you started next week. Just need you to sign here."</p>
            <p><em>Why it fails: Pressure. Assumes the close. Forces a decision.</em></p>
        </div>

        <div class="example good">
            <div class="example-title">✓ Good Closing Approach</div>

    <!-- THE TRUST CURVE -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>THE TRUST CURVE</h2>

        <p>Every sales call has a trust curve. It looks like this:</p>

        <p><strong>Opening (0-5 minutes):</strong> Trust starts at zero. You're a stranger. They're skeptical.</p>

        <p><strong>Discovery (5-15 minutes):</strong> Trust builds if you demonstrate radical relevance. Drops if you're generic.</p>

        <p><strong>Presentation (15-30 minutes):</strong> Trust compounds if you're giving value. Drops if you're pitching too hard.</p>

        <p><strong>Close (30+ minutes):</strong> Trust peaks if you've earned permission. Drops if you push.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            The buyer decides whether to buy you in the first 10 minutes. They decide whether to buy your solution in the last 10 minutes.
        </div>

        <p>Most reps focus on the last 10 minutes. They nail the pitch. They handle objections. They ask for the sale.</p>

        <p>And they wonder why deals don't close.</p>

        <p><strong>The truth:</strong> If you haven't built trust in the first 10 minutes, nothing you do in the last 10 minutes will matter.</p>

        <h3>What Kills Trust:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Generic openers ("Tell me about your business")</li>
            <li>Feature dumps (showing everything instead of solving their problem)</li>
            <li>Pushy closes (assuming forward motion without permission)</li>
            <li>Giving away strategy for free (free consulting kills your positioning)</li>
            <li>Not respecting their time (going over time, not having an agenda)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What Builds Trust:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Demonstrating understanding (radical relevance)</li>
            <li>Giving diagnostic value (frameworks, tools, insights)</li>
            <li>Asking permission at every stage (co-authoring the sale)</li>
            <li>Respecting objections (exploring them instead of handling them)</li>
            <li>Making it easy to say no (removes pressure, paradoxically increases yes rate)</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- INTEGRATION -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>USING WTF WITH OTHER FRAMEWORKS</h2>

        <p>The WTF Method isn't a replacement. It's a foundation.</p>

        <p>Here's how it integrates with the frameworks you already use:</p>

        <h3>WTF + SPIN Selling</h3>
        <p><strong>WTF first:</strong> Build radical relevance by showing you understand their context.</p>
        <p><strong>SPIN second:</strong> Deploy Situation/Problem/Implication/Need-Payoff questions.</p>
        <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Buyers answer SPIN questions honestly when they trust you've already done the homework.</p>

        <h3>WTF + Challenger</h3>
        <p><strong>WTF first:</strong> Establish diagnostic generosity by teaching them something they don't know.</p>
        <p><strong>Challenger second:</strong> Challenge their assumptions with your unique insight.</p>
        <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Buyers accept your challenge when you've already given them value.</p>

        <h3>WTF + Sandler</h3>
        <p><strong>WTF first:</strong> Use permission-based progression to establish equal business stature.</p>
        <p><strong>Sandler second:</strong> Deploy the Sandler pain funnel and disqualification tactics.</p>
        <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Buyers tolerate Sandler's direct approach when you've removed pressure first.</p>

        <h3>WTF + MEDDIC</h3>
        <p><strong>WTF first:</strong> Use radical relevance to get access to economic buyers and champions.</p>
        <p><strong>MEDDIC second:</strong> Map Metrics, Economic Buyer, Decision Criteria, Decision Process, Identify Pain, Champion.</p>
        <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Buyers give you access to decision-makers when you've proven you won't waste their time.</p>

        <h3>WTF + Gap Selling</h3>
        <p><strong>WTF first:</strong> Build trust through diagnostic generosity so buyers feel safe showing you their gaps.</p>
        <p><strong>Gap Selling second:</strong> Map current state vs. future state and the gap between them.</p>
        <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Buyers reveal their problems when they trust you won't use it against them.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            The pattern: WTF builds the trust layer. Your tactical framework executes on top of it.
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- CALL LAB TRACKING -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>TRACK YOUR PROGRESS</h2>

        <p>The WTF Method is a skill. Like any skill, you get better by tracking your performance.</p>

        <p>That's where Call Lab Pro comes in.</p>

        <h3>What Call Lab Pro Tracks:</h3>

        <p><strong>Radical Relevance Score:</strong> Did you demonstrate understanding before you pitched?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pattern detection: What specific insights did you share?</li>
            <li>Cultural shorthand: Did you speak their language?</li>
            <li>Peer validation: Did you reference similar clients or situations?</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Diagnostic Generosity Score:</strong> Did you give value before asking for the sale?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Value delivered: What frameworks, tools, or insights did you share?</li>
            <li>Teaching moments: When did you educate vs. pitch?</li>
            <li>Strategic giveaways: What did you give that didn't give away strategy?</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Permission-Based Progression Score:</strong> Did you ask or did you push?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Permission checkpoints: How many times did you ask "Does this make sense?"</li>
            <li>Pressure points: When did you assume forward motion without asking?</li>
            <li>Co-authoring: Did you make them part of the solution design?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Your Trust Curve (Pro Only)</h3>

        <p>Call Lab Pro maps your trust curve across every call. You'll see:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>When trust builds (what you said that worked)</li>
            <li>When trust drops (what you said that didn't)</li>
            <li>Your trust peak (the moment they decided to buy you)</li>
            <li>Your conversion probability (based on trust curve shape)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>After 10 calls, you'll know YOUR patterns. What YOU do that works. What YOU do that kills deals.</p>

        <p>That's not theory. That's your actual data.</p>
